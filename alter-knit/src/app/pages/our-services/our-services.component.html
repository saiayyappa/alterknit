              Through a process known as REKNITTING, our repair team uses yarn from the original garment to REKNIT the
              damaged area matching the pattern and style. The work is done by hand and most times under a magnifying
              glass to make sure that it's done just right.

              For small damage on suits our repair team uses a method known as FRENCH REWEAVING, where the damaged area
              is rewoven. For larger damage on suits, a piece of fabric is taken from an unnoticeable area of the
              garment and is inlaid, matching the pattern of the garment exactly. In some cases, a faint outline might
              show.

          <p>
            Our team is made of professionals with years of large-run textile and knitting production
            experience. Because of this, we are able to perform repairs and knit alterations like no one else.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our speciality is reknitting and reweaving depending on whether it's a knit or woven fabric. It is done by
            hand and produces a nearly invisible repair and maintains the integrity of the garment. Fiber is
            discreetly taken from the original garment so the repair blends naturally into the fabric. If we are
            unable to take it from the garment itself, we have an extensive fiber library to draw upon.
          </p>
          <p>
            When reknitting or reweaving is not an option, we find another solutions to save your garment.
            Because we are based in New York we have access to fabrics, trims, leather, and notions - Thank you NYC
            Garment District! This allows us to go that extra mile on repair solutions. We will make the damage a far
            distant memory!
          </p>
          <p>
            Finding a reweaver or reknitter was once very easy. However, over the years, the skill was not passed on.
            Today there are only a handful of reputable sources from whom you can receive this service. We are proud to
            be keeping this lost art alive with the help of your support.

            We will provide you with an estimated time of completion. Orders requiring reknitting and/or reweaving are
            time-consuming as every garment needs custom attention and much patience. The majority of the repairs we
            make are done by hand. Please take this into consideration while you are waiting in the fix-it line.

          <p>
            On average, most repairs take four to six weeks not including the shipping time. However, if you have a time
